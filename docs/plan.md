## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- OCR accuracy rate > 85%
- API response times < 500ms
- Upload processing time < 30 seconds
- System uptime > 99%

### User Experience Metrics
- Receipt processing success rate > 90%
- User onboarding completion > 80%
- Notification delivery reliability > 95%
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

## Risk Mitigation
